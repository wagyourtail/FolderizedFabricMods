# Folderized Fabric Mods

This mod allows for loading other mods for a folder stucture in the mods folder.

There are several folder types. you can specify a folder with multiple mod versions seperated by commas (ie.
`1.16.2,1.16.3`) or major version matching (ie. `1.15.X`).

## This mod is very modloader specific
make sure to update the fabric-loader on your older minecraft versions to match.

Mod versions will specify which versions of the fabric loader they will work with before their own version number.

For example, the main branch currently works on Fabric Loader `0.10.X`, so the mod's filename will be `modfolders-0.10.X-version.jar`
where version is the actual version number.
